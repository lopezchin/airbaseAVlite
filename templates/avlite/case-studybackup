<p>Avlite’s automated solar runway lighting solution significantly reduces operation costs, enhances airport efficiency and improves safety.</p>
<p>After an immediate catastrophic failure of the 20+ year old lighting system which was deemed at assessment to be irreparable, an alternative lighting system for the runway, taxiway and illuminated wind indicator (IWI) at Exmouth Aerodrome was required.  </p>
<p>A review of available products saw solar LED lighting being the best value for money, at around a third of the cost of a traditional mains-powered system.</p>

<p><strong><strong>RACQ CareFlight Rescue - based in Toowoomba, Queensland required a solar powered helipad lighting system to enhance the safety of its HEMS crew and passengers during night missions or in adverse weather conditions. </strong></strong></p>
<p>Located at the edge of Australia’s Great Dividing Range escarpment at an altitude of seven hundred meters above sea-level, weather conditions at the Toowoomba base can be bleak at any time of the day or night.  And with around 80% of CareFlight’s 500 rescue missions taking off and landing at the busy Toowoomba base every year, an improvement to the existing but limited hanger-mounted spot lighting was seen as necessary to enhance base operations and improve the safety of pilots, crew and passengers.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0003ff;"><em>“As the busiest HEMS base in Queensland, the benefits [of Avlite’s helipad lighting system] to CareFlight Rescue’s Toowoomba base are many.

<h4 class="post__title">Avlite Aviation Lights Improve Helipad Safety at Queensland’s Major Heart Specialist Hospital</h4>
<input id="recNo" class="recNo" type="hidden" value="19" />
<div class="read-more-content hide">
<p>Avlite was chosen as the supplier for aviation lighting products for the Helicopter Landing Site at the The Prince Charles Hospital because it is an Australian company that supplies quality lighting suited to the extreme Queensland environment.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #0003ff;">“As The Prince Charles Hospital is the heart specialist hospital in Queensland it was important that we increased our services by constructing a state of the art helipad to deliver better service to the Queensland public. The most impressive thing I liked about Avlite products was the quality and ease of installation.” </span></em></strong></p>
